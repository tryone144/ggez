//! ggez is a Rust library to create a Good Game Easily.
//!
//! The current version is 0.9.3.
//!
//! More specifically, ggez is a lightweight cross-platform game framework
//! for making 2D games with minimum friction.  It aims to implement an
//! API based on (a Rustified version of) the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/)
//! game framework.  This means it contains basic and portable 2D
//! drawing, sound, resource loading and event handling, but finer details
//! and performance characteristics may be different than LÖVE.
//!
//! ggez is not meant to be everything to everyone, but rather a good
//! base upon which to build.  Thus it takes a fairly
//! batteries-included approach without needing a million additions
//! and plugins for everything imaginable, but also does not dictate
//! higher-level functionality such as physics engine or entity
//! component system.  Instead the goal is to allow you to use
//! whichever libraries you want to provide these functions, or build
//! your own libraries atop ggez.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * Filesystem abstraction that lets you load resources from folders or zip files
//! * Hardware-accelerated 2D rendering built on the `wgpu` graphics API
//! * Loading and playing .ogg, .wav and .flac files via the `rodio` crate
//! * TTF font rendering with `glyph_brush`.
//! * Interface for handling keyboard and mouse events easily through callbacks
//! * Config file for defining engine and game settings
//! * Easy timing and FPS measurement functions.
//! * Math library integration with `mint`.
//! * Some more advanced graphics options: shaders, instanced draws and render targets
//!
//! ### Supported platforms
//!
//!  * Fully supported: Windows, Linux
//!  * Not officially supported but might work anyway: Mac
//!
//! For details, see [docs/BuildingForEveryPlatform.md](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/BuildingForEveryPlatform.md)
//!
//! If you want to run ggez on Android, iOS or the web using WebAssembly take a look at [good-web-game](https://github.com/ggez/good-web-game).
//!
//! ## Who's using ggez?
//!
//! Check out the [projects list!](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/Projects.md)
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ggez requires rustc >= 1.42 and is distributed on
//! crates.io. To include it in your project, just add the dependency
//! line to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```text
//! ggez = "0.9.3"
//! ```
//!
//! ggez consists of three main parts: A `Context` object which
//! contains all the state required to interface with the computer's
//! hardware, an `EventHandler` trait that the user implements to
//! register callbacks for events, and various sub-modules such as
//! `graphics` and `audio` that provide the functionality to actually
//! get stuff done.  The general pattern is to create a struct holding
//! your game's data which implements the `EventHandler` trait.
//! Create a new `Context` object with default objects from a `ContextBuilder`
//! or `Conf` object, and then call `event::run()` with
//! the `Context` and an instance of your `EventHandler` to run your game's
//! main loop.
//!
//! See the [API docs](https://docs.rs/ggez/) for full documentation, or the [examples](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/tree/master/examples) directory for a number of commented examples of varying complexity.  Most examples show off
//! a single feature of ggez, while `astroblasto` and `snake` are small but complete games.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! For a quick tutorial on ggez, see the [Hello ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/guides/HelloGgez.md) guide in the `docs/` directory.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! See the `examples/` directory in the source.  Most examples show off
//! a single feature of ggez, while `astroblasto` is a small  but
//! complete Asteroids-like game.
//!
//! To run the examples, just check out the source and execute `cargo run --example`
//! in the root directory:
//!
//! ```text
//! git clone https://github.com/ggez/ggez.git
//! cd ggez
//! cargo run --example 05_astroblasto
//! ```
//!
//! If this doesn't work, see the
//! [FAQ](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md) for solutions
//! to common problems.
//!
//! ### Basic Project Template
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use ggez::{Context, ContextBuilder, GameResult};
//! use ggez::graphics::{self, Color};
//! use ggez::event::{self, EventHandler};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Make a Context.
//!     let (mut ctx, event_loop) = ContextBuilder::new("my_game", "Cool Game Author")
//!         .build()
//!         .expect("aieee, could not create ggez context!");
//!
//!     // Create an instance of your event handler.
//!     // Usually, you should provide it with the Context object to
//!     // use when setting your game up.
//!     let my_game = MyGame::new(&mut ctx);
//!
//!     // Run!
//!     event::run(ctx, event_loop, my_game);
//! }
//!
//! struct MyGame {
//!     // Your state here...
//! }
//!
//! impl MyGame {
//!     pub fn new(_ctx: &mut Context) -> MyGame {
//!         // Load/create resources such as images here.
//!         MyGame {
//!             // ...
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! impl EventHandler for MyGame {
//!    fn update(&mut self, _ctx: &mut Context) -> GameResult {
//!         // Update code here...
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//!
//!     fn draw(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) -> GameResult {
//!         let mut canvas = graphics::Canvas::from_frame(ctx, Color::WHITE);
//!         // Draw code here...
//!         canvas.finish(ctx)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation details
//!
//! ggez is built upon `winit` for windowing and events, `rodio` for
//! sound, and a 2D drawing engine implemented with `wgpu`. It is entirely
//! thread-safe (though platform constraints mean the event-handling loop
//! and drawing must be done in the main thread), and portable to Windows
//! and Linux.
//!
//! ggez is pure Rust™.
